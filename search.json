persistentes en el oeste de Galicia y del Sistema Central, Estrecho y vertiente oeste de las Béticas. Tormentas en el suroeste peninsular. Rachas muy fuertes de viento de oeste, en el este peninsular, sistemas Béticos, montañas del extremo norte, Baleares y litorales del sur y noroeste peninsular. B.- PREDICCIÓN Se mantendrá la inestabilidad en la mayor parte de la Península bajo la influencia de la borrasca Leonardo, estacionaria al sur de Irlanda y ya en fase madura. Así, predominarán los cielos nubosos y precipitaciones generalizadas en la vertiente atlántica, Alborán y Aragón, siendo menos abundantes que en días previos. Se esperan precipitaciones, aunque de carácter débil y ocasional, en el Cantábrico, Baleares, fachada oriental y resto del nordeste peninsular, con un predominio de cielos poco nubosos o con intervalos nubosos en estas zonas. Los mayores acumulados se esperan en el oeste de Galicia y del Sistema Central, Estrecho y vertiente oeste de las Béticas, pudiendo ser persistentes. Asimismo, podrán ir ocasionalmente acompañadas de tormenta y granizo en zonas del oeste peninsular y litoral sur. Se prevén nevadas en montañas de la mitad norte una cota de 1100/1500 m, pudiendo bajar en el noroeste 900 m al final, y en las del sureste partir de 1400/1800 m. En Canarias, cielos nubosos con posibilidad de alguna lluvia débil y dispersa al principio, tendiendo poco nuboso. Bancos de niebla matinales en regiones de montaña. Descensos generalizados de las temperaturas, con las mínimas al final del día, en la Península y Canarias. Solamente en el tercio nordeste peninsular las temperaturas máximas aumentarán y las mínimas permanecerán sin cambios. En Baleares, mínimas sin cambios y máximas en descenso. Heladas débiles en montañas de la mitad norte peninsular, moderadas en Pirineos. Predominará el viento moderado del oeste y suroeste en la Península y Baleares, flojo en el interior del tercio nordeste peninsular y alcanzando intervalos fuertes y rachas muy fuertes en Baleares y litorales del sur y noroeste peninsular. Se esperan además rachas muy fuertes en el este peninsular, sistemas Béticos y montañas del extremo norte. En Canarias, viento moderado de componente norte con intervalos de fuerte.","code":"# endpoint, today forecast  today <- \"/api/prediccion/nacional/hoy\"  # Metadata knitr::kable(get_metadata_aemet(today)) # Data pred_today <- get_data_aemet(today) #> ℹ Results are MIME type: \"text/plain\". #> → Returning data as UTF-8 string. # Produce a result  clean <- gsub(\"\\r\", \"\\n\", pred_today, fixed = TRUE) clean <- gsub(\"\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", clean, fixed = TRUE)  cat(\"<blockquote>\", clean, \"<\/blockquote>\", sep = \"\\n\")"},{"path":"https://ropenspain.github.io/climaemet/articles/extending-climaemet.html","id":"example-maps","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Example: Maps","title":"Extending climaemet","text":"AEMET also provides map data, usually image/gif format.
