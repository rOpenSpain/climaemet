Since the last release, this package has been integrated into [rOpenSpain](https://ropenspain.es/), 
a community of **R** enthusiasts whose ultimate goal is to create 
high-quality **R** packages for data mining public Spanish open sources.

From version **1.0.0** onward, we have introduced some improvements 
and (breaking) changes on the package, in order to provide a smoother
 interaction with the AEMET API service.

If it is your first time using **climaemet v1.0.0** you may see the 
following message:


```r
library(climaemet)
#>
#> Welcome to climaemet (1.0.0)
#> Note that since climaemet (>=1.0.0) the results are provided on tibble format. Run `climaemet_news()` to see the changelog.
#> If you experience any problem open an issue on https://github.com/rOpenSpain/climaemet/issues
#>
#>
#> Check aemet_api_key() to see how you can set you AEMET API Key
```

We have you covered! Run `help("aemet_api_key", package = "climaemet")` 
to learn how to set your API Key. We would explain the details on the 
next section.

## API Key

### Note for existing users

**Your previous code will break**. This is because we have deprecated 
the use of the `apikey` parameter in all the functions. This can be a 
little frustrating at the beginning but we believe the approach 
implemented in **v1.0.0** is the way to go in terms of best practices.

### Get your API Key

To be able to download data from AEMET you will need a free API key 
which you can get at 
<https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/obtencionAPIKey>

Once that you have your API Key, you can use any of the following 
methods:

#### a. Set API Key with `aemet_api_key()`

This is the recommended option. Just type:


```r
aemet_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", install = TRUE)
```

Using `install = TRUE` ensures that the API key is stored on your 
local computer and it would be reloaded every time you load the 
library. From now on you can forget about API keys!

#### b. Use an environment variable

This is a temporary alternative. You can set your API key as an 
environment variable


```r
Sys.setenv(AEMET_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

Note that this is only valid for the current session. You would 
need to re-run this command each time you restart your session.

#### c. Modify your `.Renviron` file

This stores your API key permanently on your machine. You can 
start editing your `.Renviron` running this command:

```r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Now you can add the following line to you `.Renviron` file:

```
AEMET_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
```

## New features

### `tidyverse` format

From **v1.0.0** onward, **climaemet** provides its results in 
[tibble format](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). Also, the 
functions try to guess the correct format of the fields (i.e. 
something as a Date/Hour now is an hour, numbers are parsed as 
double, etc.).

See how a tibble is displayed:


```r
# See a tibble in action

aemet_last_obs("9434")
#> # A tibble: 23 x 25
#>    idema   lon fint                 prec   alt  vmax    vv    dv   lat  dmax ubi      pres    hr stdvv    ts

#> # ... with 13 more rows, and 10 more variables: pres_nmar <dbl>, tamin <dbl>, ta <dbl>, tamax <dbl>,
#> #   tpr <dbl>, stddv <dbl>, inso <dbl>, tss5cm <dbl>, pacutp <dbl>, tss20cm <dbl>
```

Note that when possible, data representing dates and numbers are 
converted to the right format.

### Spatial objects: `sf`

Another major change in **v1.0.0** is the ability of return 
information on spatial `sf` format, using `return_sf = TRUE`. 
The coordinate reference system (CRS) used is **EPSG 4326**, 
that correspond to the **World Geodetic System (WGS)** and 
return coordinates in latitude/longitude (unprojected coordinates):


```r

# You would need to install `sf` if not installed yet
# run install.packages("sf") for installation

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

all_stations <- aemet_last_obs(return_sf = TRUE)
# Last hour
all_last <-
  all_stations %>% filter(fint == all_stations[["fint"]][1])

last_hour <- max(all_last$fint)


ggplot(all_last) +
  geom_sf(aes(col = ta),
    shape = 19,
    size = 2
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature in Spain",
    subtitle = last_hour,
    color = "Max temp.\n(celsius)",
    caption = "Source: AEMET"
  ) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(
    colours = hcl.colors(5, "RdBu", rev = TRUE),
    guide = "legend",
    n.breaks = 7
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 23, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16, face = "italic"),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 15),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 15),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 15)
  )
```

## Further enhancements

Other enhancements included on the **v1.0.0**:

-   All the functions are now vectorized.
-   New function `get_metadata_aemet()`.
-   New function `ggclimat_walter_lieth()`. This function is now 
the default for `climatogram_*` functions (experimental). Old 
behavior can be reproduced with options `ggplot2 = FALSE`.
-   Plot functions gains new parameters (`verbose` and `...`). 
Now it is possible to pass colors to the plotting functions.
-   New example datasets: `climaemet::climaemet_9434_climatogram`, `climaemet::climaemet_9434_temp`, `climaemet::climaemet_9434_wind`.
