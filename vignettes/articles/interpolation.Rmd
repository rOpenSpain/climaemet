**climaemet** can retrieve data from the stations included on [AEMET Open
Data](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio). However, in terms of
spatial analysis and visualization, it can be useful to extend the data from
points (stations) to the whole extent of Spain. On this article we would explain
a method to interpolate the climatic data trough [Spatial
Interpolation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/spatial_analysis_interpolation.html),
that is the process of using points with known values to estimate values at
other unknown points.

## Initial config

For this analysis, we would need the following libraries:

```{r libraries}
library(climaemet)
library(mapSpain) # Base maps of Spain
library(sf) # spatial shape handling
library(gstat) # for spatial interpolation
library(dplyr) # data handling
library(ggplot2) # for plots
library(gganimate) # we would create an animation
library(gifski)
```

## Retrieving data

We choose here the daily climatic data from Winter 2020-2021 in Spain. Note that
on the first half of January, [Storm
Filomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Filomena) brought unusual heavy
snowfall to parts of Spain, with Madrid recording its heaviest snowfall since
1971. We should be able to spot that.

```{r climatic_data}
clim_data <- aemet_daily_clim(
  start = "2020-12-21",
  end = "2021-03-20",
  return_sf = TRUE
)

clim_data_clean <- clim_data %>%
  # Exclude Canary Islands from analysis
  filter(!provincia %in% c("LAS PALMAS", "STA. CRUZ DE TENERIFE")) %>%
  dplyr::select(fecha, tmed) %>%
  # Exclude NAs
  filter(!is.na(tmed))

summary(clim_data_clean$tmed)

ggplot(clim_data_clean) +
  geom_sf()
```

We load also a basic shapefile of Spain using **mapSpain**:

```{r geo_data}
CCAA <- esp_get_ccaa(epsg = 4326) %>%
  # Exclude Canary Islands from analysis
  filter(ine.ccaa.name != "Canarias")

ggplot(CCAA) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = clim_data_clean)
```

As it can be seed, the climatic data we have available so far is restricted to
the stations (points), but we want to extend these values to the whole
territory.

## Filling the gaps: Interpolation

As we need to predict values at locations where no measurements have been made,
we would need to interpolate the data. On this example we would apply the
[Inverse Distance Weighted
method](https://rspatial.org/raster/analysis/4-interpolation.html#inverse-distance-weighted),
that is one of several approaches to perform spatial interpolation. We recommend
[this article](https://rspatial.org/raster/analysis/4-interpolation.html) on how
to perform these analysis on **R**.

The process would be as follow:

-   Create an spatial object (grid) where the predicted values would be applied.
-   Perform an spatial interpolation.
-   Visualize the results.

### Creating a grid

For this analysis, we need a destination object with the locations to be
predicted. A common technique is to create a spatial grid (a "raster") covering
the targeted locations.

On this example, we would use **sf** to create a regular grid that would be
converted into a **raster**.

**An important thing to consider in any spatial analysis or visualization** is
the [coordinate reference system
(CRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system). We won't cover
this in detail on this article, but we should mention a few key considerations:

-   When using several spatial objects, we should ensure that **all of them
    present the same CRS**. This can be achieved projecting the objects (i.e.
    transforming their coordinates) to the same CRS.
-   Longitude/latitude coordinates are unprojected coordinates. When we project
    an object (i.e. Mercator projection) we actually change the values of every
    point (x,y) coordinates (i.e. a projection is a transformation of the
    coordinates.)
-   For measuring distance in meters, etc. we should choose the right
    projection. Distances on unprojected coordinates are meaningless. Think that
    1 degree of longitude on the equator means 111 kms but on the North Pole
    means roughly 0.11 m. The degrees just split a circumference on equally
    spaced buckets, but the Earth is an spheroid and the circumferences at
    different latitudes doesn't have the same length (opposed to a cylinder,
    where circumferences are the same at any latitude or y-axis.)

On this exercise, we choose to project our objects to **ETRS89 / UTM zone 30N**
[EPSG:25830](https://epsg.io/25830), that provides x and y values on meters and
maximizes the accuracy for Spain.

```{r project}
clim_data_utm <- st_transform(clim_data_clean, 25830)
CCAA_utm <- st_transform(CCAA, 25830)

# Note the original projection

st_crs(CCAA)$proj4string

# vs the utm projection

st_crs(CCAA_utm)$proj4string
```

Now, we create a regular grid using **sf**. This grid is composed to equally
spaced points over the whole extent (bounding box) of Spain.

We use here a density of 5000 (m), so the grid density is 5 x 5 kms (25 km2):

```{r create_grid}
# Create grid 5*5 km (25 km2)

grd_sf <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(CCAA_utm)) %>%
  st_make_grid(cellsize = 5000, what = "centers")

# Number of points

length(grd_sf)
```

### Interpolating the data

Now we just need to populate the (empty) grid with the predicted values based on
the observations:

```{r interpolate}
# Test with a single day

test_day <- clim_data_utm %>% filter(fecha == "2021-01-08")

# Interpolate temp

interp_temp <- gstat::idw(tmed ~ 1,
  # Formula interpolation
  test_day,
  # Origin
  newdata = grd_sf,
  # Destination
  idp = 2.0
)

plot(interp_temp["var1.pred"])
```

Let's create a nice **ggplot2** plot! See also @roye2020 for more on this.

```{r ggplot_interpolate}
# Making a nice plot on ggplot2
coords <- st_coordinates(interp_temp)
values <- interp_temp$var1.pred

temp_values <- data.frame(
  x = coords[, 1],
  y = coords[, 2],
  temp = values
)

# Get min and max from interpolated values
min_temp <- floor(min(temp_values$temp))
max_temp <- ceiling(max(temp_values$temp))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = CCAA_utm, fill = "grey95") +
  geom_tile(data = temp_values, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = temp)) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = hcl.colors(11, "Spectral", rev = TRUE, alpha = 0.7),
    limits = c(min_temp, max_temp)
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  labs(
    title = "Avg. Temperature in Spain",
    subtitle = "2021-01-08",
    caption = "Data: AEMET, IGN",
    fill = "C"
  )
```

## Animation

On this section, we would loop over the dates to create a final animation to
observe the evolution of temperature through the winter of 2020/21.

```{r animate, eval=FALSE}
# Extending and animating
dates <- sort(unique(clim_data_clean$fecha))


# Loop through days and interpolate

interp_res <- NULL

for (i in seq_len(length(dates))) {
  thisdate <- dates[i]
  tmp_day <- clim_data_utm %>% filter(fecha == thisdate)

  interp_day <-
    gstat::idw(tmed ~ 1,
      tmp_day,
      newdata = grd_sf,
      idp = 2.0
    )

  # Select only points in the area
  inside <- st_contains(st_union(CCAA_utm), interp_day, sparse = TRUE)
  interp_day <- interp_day[unlist(inside), ]

  coords <- st_coordinates(interp_day)
  values <- interp_day$var1.pred

  interp_day <- data.frame(
    x = coords[, 1],
    y = coords[, 2],
    temp = values
  )


  interp_day$id <-
    seq_len(nrow(interp_day)) # We would need the id later
  interp_day$fecha <- thisdate

  interp_res <- dplyr::bind_rows(interp_res, interp_day)
}
```

Now we use **gganimate** to create the animation:

```{r create_gif, eval=FALSE}
min_temp2 <- floor(min(interp_res$temp))
max_temp2 <- ceiling(max(interp_res$temp))


anim <- ggplot() +
  geom_tile(data = interp_res, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = temp)) +
  geom_sf(data = CCAA_utm, fill = "transparent") +
  coord_sf(expand = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = hcl.colors(20, "Spectral", rev = TRUE, alpha = 0.8),
    limits = c(min_temp2, max_temp2),
    labels = function(x) {
      paste0(x, "º")
    }
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  transition_time(fecha) +
  labs(
    title = "Avg. Temperature in Spain",
    subtitle = "{frame_time}",
    caption = "Data: AEMET, IGN",
    fill = ""
  )

anim_save("winter_2021.gif", anim,
  duration = length(dates), # 1 date per second
  rewind = TRUE
)
```

```{r include_gif, echo=FALSE}
# From cache
knitr::include_graphics("winter_2021.gif")
```

## Geogrid

Let's plot an histogram for each Autonomous Community using the `geofacet`
package:

```{r geofacet, fig.asp=1}
library(geofacet)

clim_data_geofacet <- clim_data %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(fecha, tmed, provincia) %>%
  filter(!is.na(tmed))

# Paste Province info and codes
clim_data_mean <- clim_data_geofacet %>%
  mutate(name_norm = ifelse(
    provincia == "STA. CRUZ DE TENERIFE",
    "Santa Cruz de Tenerife",
    provincia
  )) %>%
  mutate(name_norm = esp_dict_translate(name_norm, "es")) %>%
  mutate(cpro = esp_dict_region_code(name_norm, destination = "cpro"))

# Paste CCAA codes and names
clim_data_mean <- clim_data_mean %>%
  left_join(esp_codelist, by = "cpro") %>%
  group_by(fecha, ine.ccaa.name, codauto) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_tmed = mean(tmed, na.rm = TRUE),
    obs = n(),
    .groups = "keep"
  ) %>%
  mutate(code = codauto)

# Label the grid with shortnames
ccaagrid <- geofacet::spain_ccaa_grid1 %>%
  left_join(esp_codelist[c("codauto", "ccaa.shortname.es")],
    by = c("code" = "codauto")
  ) %>%
  mutate(name = ccaa.shortname.es) %>%
  select(-ccaa.shortname.es) %>%
  distinct()

# Abbrev.
ccaagrid$name <- gsub("Comunidad", "C.", ccaagrid$name)

# Plot
ggplot(clim_data_mean, aes(fecha, mean_tmed)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue") +
  # Line on Filomena peak
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = as.Date("2021-01-08"),
    colour = "red"
  ) +
  facet_geo(~code,
    grid = ccaagrid,
    scales = "fixed",
    label = "name"
  ) +
  ylab("Mean Temperature") +
  xlab("") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7),
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      color = "grey20",
      size = 5,
      angle = 90,
      hjust = .5,
      vjust = .5,
      face = "plain"
    ),
    axis.text.y = element_text(
      color = "grey20",
      size = 5,
      angle = 0,
      hjust = 1,
      vjust = 0,
      face = "plain"
    )
  )
```
