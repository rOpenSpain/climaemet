<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **climaemet** is to serve as an interface to download the climatic
data of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) directly from R using their
[API](https://opendata.aemet.es/) and create scientific graphs (climate charts,
trend analysis of climate time series, temperature and precipitation anomalies
maps, "warming stripes" graphics, climatograms, etc.).

Browse manual and vignettes at <https://ropenspain.github.io/climaemet/>.

## AEMET Open Data

AEMET OpenData is a REST API developed by AEMET that allows the dissemination
and reuse of the Agency's meteorological and climatological information. To see
more details visit: <https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio>

## License for the original data

Information prepared by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (Â© AEMET). You can
read about it [here](https://www.aemet.es/en/nota_legal).

A summary for the usage of the data could be interpreted as:

> People can use freely this data. You should mention AEMET as the collector of
> the original data in every situation except if you are using this data
> privately and individually. AEMET makes no warranty as to the accuracy or
> completeness of the data. All data are provided on an "as is" basis. AEMET is
> not responsible for any damage or loss derived from the interpretation or use
> of this data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **climaemet** from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("climaemet")
```

You can install the developing version of **climaemet** using the
[r-universe](https://ropenspain.r-universe.dev/climaemet):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install climaemet in R:
install.packages("climaemet",
  repos = c("https://ropenspain.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

Alternatively, you can install the developing version of **climaemet** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("ropenspain/climaemet")
```

## API key

To be able to download data from AEMET you will need a free API key which you
can get [here](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/obtencionAPIKey).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(climaemet)

## Get api key from AEMET
browseURL("https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/obtencionAPIKey")

## Use this function to register your API Key temporarly or permanently
aemet_api_key("MY API KEY")
```

### Changes on v1.0.0!

Now the `apikey` parameter on the functions have been deprecated. You may need
to set your API Key globally using `aemet_api_key()`. Note that you would need
also to remove the `apikey` parameter on your old codes.

## Now **climaemet** is tidy...

From `v1.0.0` onward, **climaemet** provides its results in [`tibble`
format](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). Also, the functions try to guess the
correct format of the fields (i.e. something as a Date/Hour now is an hour,
numbers are parsed as double, etc.).

```{r tibble, message=TRUE}
library(climaemet)

# See a tibble in action

aemet_last_obs("9434")
```

### Examples

The package provides several functions to access the data of the API. Here you
can find some examples:

```{r api}
## Get AEMET stations
stations <- aemet_stations() # Need to have the API Key registered

knitr::kable(head(stations))

station <- "9434" # Zaragoza Aeropuerto

## Get last observation values for a station
data_observation <- aemet_last_obs(station)

knitr::kable(head(data_observation))

## Get daily/annual climatology values for a station
data_daily <- aemet_daily_clim(station,
  start = "2022-01-01",
  end = "2022-06-30"
)

knitr::kable(head(data_daily))


## Get monthly/annual climatology values for a station
data_monthly <- aemet_monthly_clim(station, year = 2022)
knitr::kable(head(data_monthly))


## Get recorded extreme values of temperature for a station
data_extremes <- aemet_extremes_clim(station, parameter = "T")
knitr::kable(head(data_extremes))
```

We can also draw a "warming stripes" graph with the downloaded data from a
weather station. These functions returns **ggplot2** plots:

```{r climatestripes, fig.asp=0.7, eval=TRUE}
# Plot a climate stripes graph for a period of years for a station

library(ggplot2)

# Example data
temp_data <- climaemet::climaemet_9434_temp

ggstripes(temp_data, plot_title = "Zaragoza Airport") +
  labs(subtitle = "(1950-2020)")
```

Furthermore, we can draw the well-known Walter & Lieth climatic diagram for a
weather station and over a specified period of time:

```{r climatogram, fig.asp=0.7, eval=TRUE}
# Plot of a Walter & Lieth climatic diagram for a station

# Example data
wl_data <- climaemet::climaemet_9434_climatogram

ggclimat_walter_lieth(wl_data,
  alt = "249", per = "1981-2010",
  est = "Zaragoza Airport"
)
```

Additionally, we may be interested in drawing the wind speed and direction over
a period of time for the data downloaded from a weather station.:

```{r windrose, fig.asp=0.7, eval=TRUE}
# Plot a windrose showing the wind speed and direction for a station

# Example data
wind_data <- climaemet::climaemet_9434_wind

speed <- wind_data$velmedia
direction <- wind_data$dir

ggwindrose(
  speed = speed, direction = direction,
  speed_cuts = seq(0, 16, 4), legend_title = "Wind speed (m/s)",
  calm_wind = 0, n_col = 1, plot_title = "Zaragoza Airport"
) +
  labs(subtitle = "2000-2020", caption = "Source: AEMET")
```

## ... and spatial!

Another major change in `v1.0.0` is the ability of return information on spatial
`sf` format, using `return_sf = TRUE`. The coordinate reference system (CRS)
used is **EPSG 4326**, that correspond to the **World Geodetic System (WGS)**
and return coordinates in latitude/longitude (unprojected coordinates):

```{r spatial}
# You would need to install `sf` if not installed yet
# run install.packages("sf") for installation

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

all_stations <- aemet_daily_clim(
  start = "2021-01-08", end = "2021-01-08",
  return_sf = TRUE
)


ggplot(all_stations) +
  geom_sf(aes(colour = tmed), shape = 19, size = 2, alpha = 0.95) +
  labs(
    title = "Average temperature in Spain",
    subtitle = "8 Jan 2021",
    color = "Max temp.\n(celsius)",
    caption = "Source: AEMET"
  ) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(
    colours = hcl.colors(10, "RdBu", rev = TRUE),
    breaks = c(-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20),
    guide = "legend"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic")
  )
```
